# Encryption Algorithms

This project is a collection of encryption and decryption scripts developed as part of a Computer Security course in college. It implements various cryptographic algorithms taught in the course, including LFSR, Affine Cipher, Caesar Cipher, Feistel Cipher, Playfair Cipher, and S-Box. Each algorithm is implemented in Python to demonstrate secure data encryption and decryption techniques.

## Algorithms Included

- **LFSR.py**: Linear Feedback Shift Register-based encryption.
- **affine_cipher.py**: Affine Cipher, a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.
- **caesar_cipher.py**: Caesar Cipher, a simple substitution cipher.
- **feistel_cipher.py**: Feistel Cipher, a symmetric structure used in block ciphers.
- **play_fair.py**: Playfair Cipher, a digraph substitution cipher.
- **s-box.py**: S-Box (Substitution Box), a component used in many modern ciphers.
